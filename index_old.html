    <p>I created this website to practice my HTML and CSS skills I've learnt recently ! My goal is to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Build things</li>
      <li>Break things</li>
      <li>Have fun! </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introducing Myself</h2>
    <p>I'm an adventurer, foodie, golf and tennis player, occasional follower of pop culture and celebrity gossips, oh! and a happy Mom of a border collie boy, Mochi (you can find his photos <a herf='https://www.instagram.com/mochi_border_collie/', target="_blank"> here) </a> </p>
    <p>I'm originally from Sichuan, China (yes, very spicy food), studied/worked in Japan (Nara and then Tokyo), lived (a short period) and travelled extensively in Poland and Central Europe, and now a resident in California, US (you could probably tell from the picture above;). </p>

    <h2>What I'm reading these days</h2>
    <p>I'm reading this book recently: <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509', target="_blank"> The Phoenix Project</a>. It talks about DevOps management and is both informative and fun to read. I highly recommend it! </p> 
    <p>Other books I'm reading or have read recently and highly recommend: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How Computers Work - This book breaks down complex concepts such as microprocessors, transistors and digital signal processing into super clear and easy-to-understand explanations, accompanied by plenty of illustrative images. It's perfect for beginners like myself who want to grasp the nuts and bolts of how computer hardware and software function. </li>

      <li>The Body - Written by Bill Bryson, this book offers a fascinating exploration of the human body. Bryson explains the complexities of human anatomy and physiology in an engaging and accessible manner, making it a must-read for anyone interested in understanding how our bodies work.</li>

      <li>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn - Richard Hamming (Turing Award winner)'s classic book. Richard himself is a history book; his career and experiences offer a lot of incrediblely deep insights into how computers and AI have evolved to this date since the beginning. </li>
